## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile!
I'm Silas, a fourth-year HBO-ICT student at Windesheim University of Applied Sciences.

I've followed the following semesters:
- Object-Oriented Software Design & Development
- Web Development
- Quality In Software Development
- Games Programming
- Artificial Intelligence

Below, I've pinned two projects I've highlighted to showcase my programming journey so far. 

The Dungeon Not Found project was a group game project made in Unity - I developed the inventory, weapon, and loot systems and corresponding interface, contributed significantly to enemies, and developed the boss fight.  

The Computer Graphics assignment is a smaller solo project meant to showcase an intermediate understanding of C++ as a personal showcase.
